cpp is hard for doing the visual game.
conio.h and windows.h two header files are not usable in Unix-based sys like macos or Linux. Thus, there is a back off(compromise) i made.
Thus, user has to press enter after input one key of key enum(w,a,s,d) quickly to change the snake movement direction.

Too tough to fix the game display vague problem and the some logic problem.(Gave up temporarily D:)  

Removed the compiled file of the game due to diff computer need to compile again.

Here is the Compile code for c++: g++ -o output snakeGame.cpp

The macos and linux user can use this game normally.
